Our current website consists of our home landing page and a subscription page for our current provided plans

The landing page is divided into sections each using a bootsrap component or two.

The whole website is responsive and scales properly with different screen sizes using bootstrap's responsive design
and some customizations from us.

The subscribe form uses bootstrap's inbuilt form validation and shows custom messages if the user does not adhere to the 
pattern of the specific field.

The form is successfully submitted only when all fields are validated.
